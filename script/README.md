# Analysis of pangraph performance

This folder contains all the scripts used to perform the analysis of the performances of pangraph on real and simulated data reported in [the paper](##-Citing).

The analysis can be reproduced using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Complete:
- preliminary: setup conda environment
- preliminary command to pick strain pairs
- snakemake command to generate all the figures
- specify cluster execution?
